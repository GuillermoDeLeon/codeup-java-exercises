//        Create a class named GradesApplication with a main method. Inside the main method, create a HashMap named students. It should have keys that are strings that represent github usernames, and values that are Student objects. Create at least 4 student objects with at least 3 grades each, and add them to the map.
//
//        Be creative! Make up GitHub usernames and grades for your student objects.

// example of hw to create a hash map
//HashMap<String, String> usernames = new HashMap<>();
